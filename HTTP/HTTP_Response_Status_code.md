# Response Status Code

The first line of the response message (i.e., the status line) contains the response status code, which is generated by the server to indicate the outcome of the request.

## Status Code Categories

The status code is a 3-digit number categorized as follows:

- **1xx (Informational):** Request received, server is continuing the process.
- **2xx (Success):** The request was successfully received, understood, accepted, and serviced.
- **3xx (Redirection):** Further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
- **4xx (Client Error):** The request contains bad syntax or cannot be understood.
- **5xx (Server Error):** The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

## Commonly Encountered Status Codes

- **100 Continue:** The server received the request and is in the process of giving the response.
- **200 OK:** The request is fulfilled.
- **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location. The new URL is provided in the `Location` response header. The client should issue a new request to the new location. Applications should update all references to this new location.
- **302 Found & Redirect (or Moved Temporarily):** Similar to 301, but the redirection is temporary. The client should issue a new request, but applications need not update references.
- **304 Not Modified:** In response to an `If-Modified-Since` conditional GET request, the server notifies that the requested resource has not been modified.
- **400 Bad Request:** The server could not interpret or understand the request, likely due to a syntax error in the request message.
- **401 Authentication Required:** The requested resource is protected and requires client authentication (username/password). The client should resubmit the request with credentials.
- **403 Forbidden:** The server refuses to supply the resource, regardless of the client's identity.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource cannot be found on the server.
- **405 Method Not Allowed:** The request method (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) is valid, but the server does not allow that method for the requested resource.
- **408 Request Timeout:** The server timed out waiting for the request.
- **414 Request URI Too Large:** The request URI is too long for the server to process.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an unexpected condition, often caused by an error in the server-side program responding to the request.
- **501 Method Not Implemented:** The request method used is invalid (possibly due to a typo, e.g., "GET" misspelled as "Get").
- **502 Bad Gateway:** A proxy or gateway received a bad response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server cannot respond due to overloading or maintenance. The client can try again later.
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** A proxy or gateway received a timeout from an upstream server.
